# dc_trackperlvars - Damian Conway's folding-around-searches vim plugin.

Originally downloaded from https://www.bit.do/VAPIDE.

# Why?

To make it easier for me to integrate Damian's work with the other work
that I've mostly borrowed from other people.

# What?
  * perform a fold around the latest search
  * use that behavoiur to do things like
    * fold around subroutines
    * fold around comments
    * fold around use statements
    * fold all the things!
